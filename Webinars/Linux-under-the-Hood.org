  Learn the power of Linux in 3 hours.  To truly get the most out of
  Linux you need to understand Linux internals.  In this training
  session, Sander van Vugt will show you how Linux works, from seeing
  how the operating system is organized and using the C code, scripts,
  and compiled programs to exploring the kernel and hardware handling.
  Learning Linux can be challenging especially if you donâ€™t
  understand its internals.  This training session unmasks the
  complexities so you can better understand and get the most out of
  Linux today.
