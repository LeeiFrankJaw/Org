  The Cisco Certified Network Associate in Routing and Switching (CCNA
  R/S) certification is one of the most popular certifications in the
  IT industry. Attainment of this certification not only lets hiring
  managers know that youâ€™re comfortable working with Cisco routers
  and switches, but it also enhances and updates your current skill
  set.

  Interestingly, there are two ways to earn your CCNA R/S
  certification: (1) Pass two individual exams (the CCENT 100-105 and
  ICND2 200-105 exams) or (2) Pass one composite exam (the CCNA R/S
  200-125 exam). This course prepares you for whichever approach
  (i.e. the one exam or two exam approach) you choose.
