* TODO MuPDF Scripts


** TODO Combine pdf and preserve index and real page number


** TODO remove all annotation from PDF file

Some PDFs you get online is annotated by other people.  A script to
remove such annotation is helpful.


* TODO [#C] Organize Calibre Books Tags

Some tags are long and redundant with others and thus should be
splitted into smaller tags.


* TODO [#C] Maildir Script to update timestamp

Most IMAP server do not sort based mail sent date but rather the
internal date.  A script to update Maildir file timestamp is helpful
since it will reconstruct roughly correct arrival date from sent date.

* TODO [#A] Create an PR for ensime-sbt

  Java 11 now ships ~src.zip~ under ~lib~ as ~lib/src.zip~ and
  =ensime-sbt= cannot find it.

  Under Ubuntu, this also caused a problem. The file ~src.zip~ was
  linked to ~../openjdk-11/src.zip~ but should be
  ~../openjdk-11/lib/src.zip~ instead.


* TODO Discuss about a problem caused by anonymous function

  The example given at http://eed3si9n.com/gigahorse/concepts.html
  does not work; however, it works after factoring out the second
  argument to ~http.run~ as named function.



* Anchor does not work on Safari

This [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox][link]] is an example.


* Buildship won't update

See [[https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/issues/488][#488]].


* Markdown differences

On GitHub, Markdown will insert ~<br>~ tag into the output inside
paragraph.


* DBeaver peculiarities

  * Remove ~auto-increment~ from extra before unticking auto-increment
    checkbox.  Otherwise, it won't apply.

  * Removing foreign key doesn't remove automatically created index
    with the same name.

  * Sometimes you need invalidate/reconnect the connection to reflect
    the changes.


* FreeBSD after chsh, the shell doesn't update

  After you change chsh by executing /chsh/, you re-login with old
  shell.  Possible cause may be the SSH Control Master.


* Set FreeBSD locale to UTF-8

  Change =~/.login_conf= to the following.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    me:\
            :charset=UTF-8:\
            :lang=en_US.UTF-8:
  #+END_EXAMPLE


* Uninstall plugins for Safari on macOS

  Plug-ins are located under ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/~.  Simply
  remove them from this directory.

* Luatexja requires IPAEx fonts to run under Linux

  Use the following command to install IPAEx Mincho and Gothic.

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    apt install fonts-ipaexfont
  #+END_SRC


* Byzanz screencast

  It only works with flv for audio.

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    byzanz-record -v -d 15 -a screencast.flv
  #+END_SRC

  For video only, webm also works.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  byzanz-record -v -d 15 screencast.webm
#+END_SRC

  The output in ogv format cannot be played by MPlayer but can be
  played by Totem.

  Byzanz only works for relatively /short/ clips.


* System program problem detected

  Simply remove all the old crashes from directory =/var/crash/=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    rm /var/crash/*
  #+END_SRC

  Using =apport-cli= to upload these crashes may be a better option.

  See [[file:~/Portfolio/Scripts/apport][apport]] script for automation.

  The script =/usr/bin/apport-bug= is incorrect and the check of
  apport installation should be modified as follows.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    if [ "${0%-collect}" != "$0" ]; then
        prefix=/usr/bin/python3
        if ! /usr/bin/python3 -c 'import apport' 2>/dev/null; then
            echo "You need to run 'sudo apt-get install python3-apport' for apport-collect to work." >&2
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
  #+END_SRC

  The domain for apport destination is /daisy.ubuntu.com/.


* Walkaround youtube-dl problems

** Force youtube-dl to use IPv4

  Due to the primarily IPv4 infrastructure, it can be fixed sometimes
  by forcing IPv4.


** Try different formats

   Try different formats when youtube-dl complains that it doesn't get
   any data blocks.


* Disable IPv6 system-wide
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2019-10-21 Mon 12:47]--[2019-10-21 Mon 12:53] =>  0:06
  :END:

  Tools like =youtube-dl=, =wget=, =mbsync= exhibit problems with
  IPv6.  Especially for =mbsync=, it has no simple option to choose
  IPv4, unlike the other two tools.

  See [[file:~/ConfRepo/etc/sysctl.d/60-ipv6-disable.conf][60-ipv6-disable.conf]], [[file:~/ConfRepo/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01ipv6][01ipv6]], and [[file:~/ConfRepo/etc/default/grub][grub]].

* Prevent system python to add unwanted paths to =sys.path=
  :LOGBOOK:
  CLOCK: [2019-10-21 Mon 12:17]--[2019-10-21 Mon 12:47] =>  0:30
  :END:

  This behavior is mainly controlled by the =site.py= package.  Just
  set =ENABLE_USER_SITE= to =False= and comment out relevant section
  from =site.getsitepackages=.  The call to =addusersitepackages=
  actually sets =site.USER_SITE=, which is used by other packages; and
  thus don't comment it out.

  The problem with this approach is that the modification is reverted
  every time the system python is upgraded by =apt=.  This, however, can
  be solved by =dpkg-divert=.

* Gmail and Outlook.com

** IMAP behaviors

   Gmail: Auto-expunge off, move to trash, mbsync expunge slave.  This
   is only way to delete emails from IMAP for mbsync.  Use d for
   deletion.

   Outlook.com: mbsync expunge both, restoring deleted messages require
   expunge being none if trash mark was set.  Use D for deletion
   instead.

   * [[https://support.office.com/en-us/article/cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50][Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com]]


** Query Languages

   Sadly, Outlook.com has no filter for folders.  To archieve the same
   effect, you have to use the graphical interface.

   The query language for Gmail is much more expressive than that for
   Outlook.com.
