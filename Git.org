* Diff between renamed files

  The consistent way to diff between renamed files in history is to
  use blob. A blob is something like ~HEAD:lisp/jde-gen.el~

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git diff <blob> <blob>
  #+END_SRC

* Delete a branch on remote

  The old way to do it is:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git push origin :<branch-name>
  #+END_SRC

  Recent git allows you to do:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git push --delete origin <branch-name>
  #+END_SRC
